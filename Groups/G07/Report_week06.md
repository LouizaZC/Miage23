## Double Dispatch Exercices 

Last week in class, I worked on exercises about the double dispatch. I completed the dice exercise. I also started working on the paper-rock-scissors game, where I applied double dispatch to handle the interactions between different possibilities .


## Visitor Pattern in Pharo  

This week, I started learning about the Visitor pattern in Pharo, and understanding its structure and potential uses. I began by going through the slides, which helped me remember how the Visitor pattern uses modularity and double dispatch to separate behaviors from the main objects. 

## Chess Project Update
On a separate note, I’m a bit behind on my chess project as I haven’t had much time to work on it yet. I plan to dedicate more time to catch up and move forward on this project.

## Observations and Next Steps
This initial exploration of the Visitor pattern gave me a basic understanding of its mechanics. My next step is to keep practicing in class to strengthen my grasp of this pattern and also to progress on the chess project as time allows.
